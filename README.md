## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** in Java that mimics how an operating system schedules processes. It supports multiple classic algorithms and compares their performance based on key metrics like:

- ⏱️ Waiting Time  
- 🔁 Turnaround Time  
- 📊 CPU Utilization  

Ideal for students learning **Operating Systems**, especially process scheduling.

## ⚙️ Implemented Scheduling Algorithms

- 🔵 **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**  
- 🟢 **SJF (Shortest Job First)** – Non-preemptive  
- 🟡 **Priority Scheduling** – Non-preemptive  
- 🔴 **Round Robin (RR)** – with time quantum
